# My personal anime list

This is my personal anime list, a project inpired on the wesite *my anime list*, but with limitations when it comes to funcionalities. 

This projects was my first one built in NodeJs and ExpressJs, so I decided to only put the "Delete" and "Edit" funcionality, to keep it simple, only for training what I've been learning in my course.

### Technologies Used

1. NodeJS
2. Express
3. Bootstrap
4. EJS

As you can see, I used a JSON file to save the animes, I decided to do this, not only because I don't now any databases, like MongoDB or MySQL, but also to practice using the FS module from node in order to understand more about asynchrounous code with node. I also didn't focused very much on the front-end, because tha wasn't the focus of the projects.

### Final project

There are a few thing missing, like verify if an anime exists before adding to the list, form validation. I intend to work more on this project in the future and not only add all these features, but I also want to work with the My Anime List API.

I think this was enough to practice everything I've seen in my course so far, it was a small project but I could learn and reinforce a lot of conecpts.

### What I learn


1. MVC Structure
2. File System module
3. Asynchronous Code
4. Working with multiple routes and methods
5. Dynamic Paths
6. Query params
7. Work with EJS

I learned a lot with this project, but the greatest learning I got was with multiple routes, having to deal with query params, request params and request bodys, how to send them from the front end and how to work with them on the back clarified a lot how to get and work with a only item using ID.
